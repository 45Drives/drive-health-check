# drive-health-check
A tool to check the health of your drives and ensure they are as old or new as you think they are.
<br/><br/>
With recent concerns about used drives being resold as new, itâ€™s more important than ever to verify the condition of your storage devices. This tool helps you quickly assess the health, usage, ensuring you get exactly what you paid for.
<br/><br/>
  What This Tool Does:<br/>
    - Health Status: Check for signs of wear, bad sectors, and overall lifespan.<br/>
    - Usage History: See how many hours the drive has been used and how much data has been written.<br/>
    - SMART Data Analysis: Review key health indicators reported by the drive itself.<br/>
    - Peace of Mind: Confirm whether your drive is truly new or has been previously used.<br/>


There is a python script (drive-checker.py) and an executable file.
<br/>
The script can be run as follows:
<br/>
pip install WeasyPrint==52.5 pyinstaller<br/>
pyinstaller --onefile drive-checker.py --add-data "bin/smartctl:bin"<br/>
pyinstaller --onefile drive-checker.py --add-data "bin/smartctl.exe;bin"<br/>
<br/>
rename smartctl_mac to smartctl<br/>
<br/>
sudo python3 drive-checker.py --drive-check<br/>
<br/>

The executable is "main_with_drive-check.exe" and can be run.
