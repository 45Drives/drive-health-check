# drive-health-check
A tool to verify the health and authenticity of your hard drives.

  What This Tool Does:<br/>
 - Health Status – Detect signs of wear, bad sectors, and lifespan indicators.<br/>
 - Usage History – Check power-on hours and total data written.<br/>
 - SMART Data Analysis – Review key attributes reported by the drive.<br/>
